## About Me: 

Hello! I am a Math major and Biochem minor. One question I would like to answer would be what causes seeds to exit a period of dormancy. 


Six months after graduation I hope to be in grad school, I don't know specifically for what, but hopeully something related to statistics. Five years after that I hope to be working on epidemiology for the CDC. During this career I hope my greatest accoplishment is to bring a better understanding of the most effective methods of preventing the spread of malaria. Given this, I hope to learn how to explore data to discover insights about how different variables relate, as well as being able to effectively communicate this to others.

## About Me:
I’m a Statistics and Data Science major. When I first started at CU Boulder, I was a Civil Engineering major, but I slowly realized that it wasn’t something that I was incredibly passionate or good at and have now decided to start in a field where I actually have a strong interest in the subject matter. I am originally from Australia, but I have lived in the US for about 14 years. A non-statistics question I would love to have the answer to would be regarding lane changes during heavy periods of traffic; I would be curious to see if they do indeed slow down traffic, if there is a way to avoid these slowdowns if they are occurring, and just generally what can be done in order to negate stop and start traffic during rush hour. 
Six months after graduation, my goal is to be in a sports-related field analyzing data and/or just getting my foot in the door for data analysis for a team or organization. With the rise of statistical analysis in baseball, made popular by the movie “Moneyball”, sports analytics and data analysis has become a much larger part of how sports teams evaluate players and understand their skill levels, and five years from now, I would love to be doing that for a living and making a tangible difference in the way sports are understood and comprehended. I would love for my greatest career accomplishment to be enabling sports to be enjoyed by a much larger audience, either by simply improving the quality of the players in the game itself or by developing a much more interesting way of watching and analyzing games to the point where there is a much broader interest in the games beyond the physical game that is being played. Given this, I would love to learn a lot of data visualization skills through R that will allow for data to be concisely presented and easily understandable while also being attractive and intriguing to look at.

##About me:

I am a Statistics and Data Science major, and like Luke, was originally on the path to become a mechanical engineer. I thouroughly enjoy traveling, and just returned fro a trip to China and Japan. 

I would really like to know how big the change will be in the upcoming presidential election of voters that vote differently than how they did last election (specifically the difference in number of expected voters for president Trump given his approval ratings) 

6 Months after graduation I would love to see myself working outside of the US, specifically Europe, to see what its like to live in a country that isn't the United States.
5 Years after graduation I would hope to have a stable income with comfort to do hobbies I now enjoy or will learn to enjoy later in life.

I would love to own my own company or consult as a data scientist in the very long term. I imagine being my own boss would be really nice.

Given these goals, I would like to learn how to manipulate and understand data to make conclusions about things that affect my life and the lives of people around me.
