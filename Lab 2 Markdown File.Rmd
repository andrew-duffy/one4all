## About Me: 

Hello! I am a Math major and Biochem minor. One question I would like to answer would be what causes seeds to exit a period of dormancy. 


Six months after graduation I hope to be in grad school, I don't know specifically for what, but hopeully something related to statistics. Five years after that I hope to be working on epidemiology for the CDC. During this career I hope my greatest accoplishment is to bring a better understanding of the most effective methods of preventing the spread of malaria. Given this, I hope to learn how to explore data to discover insights about how different variables relate, as well as being able to effectively communicate this to others.
